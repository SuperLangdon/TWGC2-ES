# TWGC2-ES
This is the plot of the chapter 2 of the game 'Trace of Wind', just in the early stage, just my personal recreation of the origin script. 

'Trace of Wind' is a text adventure game with TraceWind (a.k.a "风痕") as the main character, developed on the [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) engine.

If you want to play the first one of this game (i.e. the original version), you can find it at next.
